# Methane Kit External Dependencies

All external [libraries](#libraries) and [build tools](#build-tools)
are integrated using [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) package manager script.
Specific versions of the dependent repositories are cloned and configured
during `MethaneKit` CMake configuration step either to the `Build/Output/ExternalsCache` directory (by default)
or to the custom location provided via CMake option `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE`.
Under CLion IDE dependent repositories are cloned inside cmake build directory of each configuration 
to support parallel cmake configurations processing.
